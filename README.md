pygame.init()

# Initialize the screen
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((400, 300))

# Draw a red rectangle
pygame.draw.rect(screen, (255, 0, 0), (50, 50, 100, 100))

# Display the screen
pygame.display.flip()

# Wait for the user to close the window
while True:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            quit()
```

If there are no errors, Pygame has been installed successfully and you can start developing games and multimedia applications with Pygame.
